# Teraform--Semester6--Infrastrcture
This was my personal repository for working with FLUX For my Semester 6 infrastructure at Fontys university of Applied sciences 
It's not much but i just wanted to work with terraform. Beacuse I didn't have any credits at a cloud provider i used it together with proxmox. What certainly sub optimal it's pretty buggy what makes it a bit annoying to use. 

## Future of this repository
Since this Repositoy was only really intended for this semester I will be archiving it if I ever need again. I will make a new repository using the things I have learned.
